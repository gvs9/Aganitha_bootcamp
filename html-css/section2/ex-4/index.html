    <h1>Mobile-Responsive Webpage</h1>
    <p>The "meta" tag with the "viewport" setting is used to make a webpage mobile-responsive. <br>
        It sets the width of the page to match the device's screen width and ensures that the initial zoom level is 1.0, providing a consistent and user-friendly viewing experience on various devices and screen sizes.<br>
    With this tag, your webpage will adapt to the screen width of the user's device, making it easier to read and navigate, whether they are using a mobile phone, tablet, or desktop computer.</p>
