# New-Project

Summary:

Project Title: Clinical Trials Data Explorer

Objective:
Develop a sophisticated web application for exploring and analyzing clinical trial data. Emphasis on user interaction, diverse data visualizations, and comprehensive insights using a rich mock dataset.

Detailed Description:
Data Visualization and Interaction Features:

Multi-Criteria Filtering: Implemented filter interface for 'Disease Type', 'Trial Phase', 'Location', 'Status', and 'Funding Source'.
Interactive Trial Details: Designed collapsible elements for trial details, including objectives, methodologies, participant demographics, and outcomes.
Diverse Data Visualizations:
Pie chart displaying the distribution of trials across different phases.
Stacked bar graph comparing the number of trials per disease type over the years.
Line graphs depicting trends in participant demographics such as age and gender.
Narrative Insights: Included narrative sections offering interpretations and summaries of data visualizations, providing insights into trial trends and patterns.
Dynamic Data Tables: Created sortable and searchable tables to display trial details, enabling users to delve into specific data points.
User Stories:

Medical Researcher: Utilize multi-criteria filters to isolate trials relevant to the field of study, aiding in research.
Data Analyst: Interact with visualizations to uncover trends in clinical trials, enhancing analysis.
Healthcare Professional: Require detailed views of trials with narrative insights to better understand implications and outcomes.
Data Requirement:
Mock Data Creation:

Used Mockaroo to generate a dataset with at least 150 rows.
Fields include Trial_ID, Disease_Type, Trial_Phase, Location, Status, Funding_Source, Participant_Count, Outcome_Success_Rate, Start_Year, and End_Year.
Data Loading Simulation:

Simulated data fetching with setTimeout to mimic asynchronous loading.
Implemented user-friendly loading indicators for an improved UX during data retrieval.
This project showcases my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, particularly in designing interactive and visually appealing web applications for data exploration and analysis. The inclusion of user stories reflects a user-centric approach, ensuring the application meets the needs of diverse stakeholders. The use of mock data creation and data loading simulation demonstrates my understanding of real-world data challenges and considerations for user experience.
