    <h1>Character Encodings</h1>
    <p>Character encodings are systems that assign a unique code to each character in a character set, enabling computers to display and process text. There are several character encoding types, with UTF-8 being one of the most commonly used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>UTF-8:</strong> Supports a wide range of characters, including those from various languages and special symbols. It's the recommended encoding for modern web documents.</li>
        <li><strong>UTF-16:</strong> Another variable-width encoding like UTF-8, but uses 16-bit code units instead of 8-bit units. It can represent a broader range of characters and is used for languages with extensive character sets.</li>
        <li><strong>ISO-8859-1:</strong> Also known as Latin-1, it is primarily used for Western European languages and includes characters like accented letters and some special symbols.</li>
        <li><strong>Shift JIS:</strong> Used for Japanese text, this encoding includes characters for the Japanese language and is not suitable for other languages.</li>
        <li><strong>EUC-KR:</strong> An encoding for Korean text, it covers the Korean Hangul script.</li>
    </ul>
