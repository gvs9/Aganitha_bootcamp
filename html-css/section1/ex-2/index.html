         This means the webpage will adapt to the screen size of the device, making it responsive. <br>
         It ensures that content is displayed correctly without the need for excessive zooming or horizontal scrolling on smaller screens. <br>
         This enhances the user experience and accessibility, making it easy for attendees to access conference information on a wide range of devices, from desktops to smartphones and tablets.</p>
