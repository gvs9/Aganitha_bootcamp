        <h2>The OSI Model</h2>
        <p>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize how different networking protocols and technologies work together in computer networks. It consists of seven layers each responsible for specific functions in the communication process:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Layer 1 - Physical:</strong>
                <p>Deals with the physical medium and transmission of raw binary data over the network.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Layer 2 - Data Link:</strong>
                <p>Handles addressing, framing, error detection and flow control.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Layer 3 - Network:</strong>
                <p>Responsible for routing and forwarding data packets between different networks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Layer 4 - Transport:</strong>
                <p>Ensures end-to-end communication error correction, and flow control between devices.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Layer 5 - Session:</strong>
                <p>Manages sessions and connections between devices including establishment, maintenance, and termination.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Layer 6 - Presentation:</strong>
                <p>Deals with data translation, encryption, and compression to ensure compatibility between different systems.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Layer 7 - Application:</strong>
                <p>The topmost layer that interacts directly with end-user applications and provides services such as email, web browsing, and file transfer.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
